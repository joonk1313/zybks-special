##Appendix
'''
under section A you can copy/paste the following code and replace "desired output" with the desired output
replace end="" with end="\n" if you want a new line after each print


if run_count == 1:
    print("this is line 1", end="")
    print("this is line2 below is a empty line", end="")
    print(, end="")
    print("dont use \n for readability", end="")
    print("anything between the quotes will be printed as is", end="")

for writing to file specify the desired filename in the exception file section
then follow simular format to the print statements above note:you cannot use end="" for writing to file
append \n to end of text if nessasary for new line
runcounts must not overlap put them out of test range or delete to deactivate
